convergence.py contains methods used to collate data relating to generation 
fitness averages and mutation rates.

This file contains the followign functions...
    - generation_data: appends average score of every 12 recipe scores
    - plotting: returns a plot that tracks average scores over time through 
        multiple generations
    - convergence_value: take the average of the converged second half of 
        score data
