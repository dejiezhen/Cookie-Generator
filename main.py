The main function takes user input to determine the number of cookie 
generations and probability of mutation before breeding generations using a 
newly created cookbook instance.  It also asks user if they want a plot of 
average fitness of each generation. 

This file contains the following functions...
    - get_generation_value: gets user input to determine the number of cookie 
        recipe generations
    - get mutation probability: gets user input to determine the mutation rate 
        of the cookie recipes
    - generate_statistic_plot: generates a statistics plot tracking the average
        fitness of each generation
